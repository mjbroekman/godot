    * I made some substantial departures from the course in a number of places, including:
      * HexTileMap / UIManager: The UIManager handles the highlight layer and terrain vs city UI determination
      * Cities have attack and defense
      * Unit (and City) attack and defense changes as they gain xp (grow)
      * Implemented 'bonus' resources
